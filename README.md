# ImageTransformer
 
The Image Transformer sample project.

This project takes an image and generates three random samples of a size specified by the user.

A dfs approach was used to ensure that the program would always find a solution if one was available, while also preventing infinite loops from occuring.

Additionally, some rudimentary exception handling was provided along with validation of user input, although both could be expanded upon.
